JTAGONIZER * Yet Another JTAG Tool

This is a set of tools for talking to hardware over JTAG, currently
supporting the popular FTDI 2232H MPSSE devices for transport.  It
does have a "driver abstraction" with the intent to support other
transports someday, but only the mpsse driver exists right now.
