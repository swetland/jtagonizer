BUGS/FEATURES
- better reset/recovery of ftdi/mpsse on start
  (if the chip has data in buffers, etc)
- allow idlestate to be the scanstate
- allow more (all?) paths between states

OPTIMIZATIONS
- background reader thread or async read
- queue multi-packet reads
- double-buffer cmd buffer to avoid blocking after tx
- prefer bitcommand over bytecommand for single-byte ios
- merge the tms motion an end of xr_scan with that of the next scan or goto
  - maybe hold the last bit from the scan and assemble against that...
